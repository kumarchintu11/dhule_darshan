          <p>Historical Background of Khandesh</p>
        </h1>
      </u>
      <p>
        `The District of Dhulia was previously known as WEST KHANDESH district.
        The ancient name of this region was Rasika. It is bounded on the east by
        Berar ( ancient Vidarbha ) , on the north by the Nemad district (
        ancient Anupa) and on the south by the Aurangabad ( ancient Mulaka ) and
        Bhir ( ancient Asmaka ) districts. Later the country came to be called
        as Seunadesa after king , Seunchandra of the Early Yadava dynasty , who
        rule over it. Subsequently its name was changed to Khandesh to suit the
        title Khan given to the Faruqi kings by Ahmad I of Gujarat. During
        Aryans penetration to the Deccan ‘Agastya’ was the first Aryan who
        crossed Vindhya and resides on the bank of Godavari. This territory was
        included in the empire of Ashoka. Pusyamitra, the founder of Sanga
        dynasty overthrow Maurya dynasty. Later on Satavahan rule over the
        region. About A.D. 250, the Satavahans were supplanted by the Abhiras in
        Western Maharashtra ( Regan Isvarsena ). The names of Feudatories of
        Abhiras ruled in Khandesh have known from copperplates discovered at
        Kalachala (Gujarath) and Cave X5II at Ajanta. After downfall of
        Satavahans the Vakatakas rose to power in Vidarbha. The Vakatakas were
        over thrown by Rastrakuta family .This region was rulled by Chalukyas of
        Badami and subsequently Yadavas. In A.D. 1296, Ala-ud-din Khilji invaded
        Ramachandra Yadava who had paid heavy ransom. His son Sankaragana
        discontinued sending the stipulated tribute to Delhi and then defected
        and slain by Malik Kafur in A.D.1318. In 1345, Devagiri was passed into
        the hands of Hasan Gangu, the founder of Bahamani dynasty. However,
        Khandesh form Southern boundaries of the Tashlug empire. In 1370, Firoz
        Taghluq assigned the district of Thalner and Karavanda to Malik Raja
        Faruqui, the founder of ‘Faruqui’ dynasty. His family claimed descent
        from the Khaliph Umer Faruq. He established himself at Thalner. The
        Governor of Gujarath honored Malik Raja with the little ‘"Sipahsalar of
        Khandesh’. From the little Khan the region came to be known as
        ‘Khandesh’ the country of Khan. During the period, a rich ahir “Asa” of
        Asirgad had many storehouse in Gondvana and Khandesh which were opened
        in order to sell the corn. However his wife was of a charitable
        disposition persuaded Asa to allow the grains to be distributed to the
        poor and suffering without payment to which Asa agreed. It was also with
        a view to employ many of the sufferers as labours that Asa leveled the
        old wall of Asir and constructed a fort built of masonry. Asa also
        distributed food to aged and decrepit who were unable to performed
        manual labour. The Ahir chief in spite of his wealth and strength of
        this fort, without any struggled acknowledged the supremacy of Malik
        Raja who bequeathed Laling to his elder son Malik Nasir and Thalner`{" "}

              Laling Killa is a small fort (killa) situated in the present day
              Dhule district of Maharashtra state in India. The fort is situated
              on top of Laling hill about 9.65 km (6.00 mi) south of Dhule city.
              It was one of the important forts in the Khandesh region during
              the time of the Faruqi Kings
              <h2>History</h2>
              It is a place of considerable antiquity and the fort is supposed
              to have been built during the reign of the first of the Faruqi
              Kings. The fact that this fort and not that of Thalner was granted
              by Malik Raja (1370-1399) to his eldest son would show that Laling
              was his chief fort. It was in this fort that Nasir Khan and his
              son Miran Adil Khan were besieged in 1437 by the Bahamani general
              till they were relieved by an army advancing from Gujarat. Early
              in the seventeenth century it is mentioned more than once in
              connection with the movements of the Mughal troop's Deccan
              campaigns [Ellior, VII, 35, 102.]. In 1862, the fort is described,
              as strongly situated with very few defences left. This fort was on
              the historical Surat-Burhanpur commercial road.
